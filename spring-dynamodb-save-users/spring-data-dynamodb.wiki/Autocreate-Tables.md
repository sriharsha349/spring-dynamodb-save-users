(This feature is available since version `5.1.0`)

The required tables for operation can be created during application startup.
This feature is inspired by Hibernate's autocreate feature and provides the following functionality via the configuration properties with the defaults below:

```
spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.auto = none
spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.gsiProjectionType = ALL
spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.readCapacity = 10
spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.writeCapacity = 1
```

# Available Modes

## none
No action will be performed.

## create-only
Database creation will be generated on ApplicationContext startup.
Please note [Creation table defaults](#Creation) details.

## drop

## create
Database dropping will be generated followed by database creation on ApplicationContext startup.

# Creation
If the table creation is required, the following defaults are applied:
* All required GSIs' use `spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.gsiProjectionType` as the projection
* All required GIS's use `spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.readCapacity` / `spring.data.dynamodb.entity2ddl.writeCapacity` for the capacity
