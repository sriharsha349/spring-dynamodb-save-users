Spring-data-dynamodb supports both findBy and queryBy repository methods in the same way:

1. It tries to build a DynamoDB QueryRequest, but is only able to do so if all properties in the method name are one of the following:
  * Hash Key
  * Range Key
  * GSI Hash Key
  * GSI Range Key
2. It will fall back on a Scan if the properties used do not fall within the list above.  For scan to work you need to annotate either the class or method with the @EnableScan annotation.

## Comparison Operators

This is the list of supported comparison operators that spring-data-dynamodb supports:

spring-data | DynamoDB | Notes/Example
--- | --- | ---
IN | EQ | (With OR concatenation)
CONTAINING | CONTAINS | 
STARTING_WITH | BEGINS_WITH |
BETWEEN | BETWEEN |
AFTER | GT |
GREATER_THAN | GT |
BEFORE | LT |
LESS_THAN | LT |
GREATER_THAN_EQUAL | GE |
LESS_THAN_EQUAL | LE |
IS_NULL | NULL |
IS_NOT_NULL | NOT_NULL |
TRUE | EQ | 
FALSE | EQ |
SIMPLE_PROPERTY | EQ | Special conditions if the property is a HashKey/RangeKey.
NEGATING_SIMPLE_PROPERTY | NE |

The list above was created by referencing this [method](https://github.com/derjust/spring-data-dynamodb/blob/master/src/main/java/org/socialsignin/spring/data/dynamodb/repository/query/AbstractDynamoDBQueryCreator.java#L70).

## Partial Supported

There is support for Sort, but it will only work if it is performed on a RangeKey.

## Unsupported operators

* Case insensitivity
* Top
* First
